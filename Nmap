"NMAP" WALKTHROUGH:-



Deploy:-

        Q.Deploy the attached VM
        Ans: No answer needed


Introduction:-

        Q.What networking constructs are used to direct traffic to the right application on a server?
        Ans: Ports

        Q. How many of these are available on any network-enabled computer?
        Ans: 65535

        Q. [Research] How many of these are considered "well-known"? (These are the "standard" numbers mentioned in the task)
        Ans: 1024


Nmap Switches:-

        Q. What is the first switch listed in the help menu for a 'Syn Scan' (more on this later!)?
        Ans: -sS

        Q. Which switch would you use for a "UDP scan"?
        Ans: -sU

        Q. If you wanted to detect which operating system the target is running on, which switch would you use?
        Ans: -O

        Q. Nmap provides a switch to detect the version of the services running on the target. What is this switch?
        Ans: -sV

        Q. The default output provided by nmap often does not provide enough information for a pentester. How would you increase the verbosity?
        Ans: -v

        Q. Verbosity level one is good, but verbosity level two is better! How would you set the verbosity level to two?
           (Note: it's highly advisable to always use at least this option)
        Ans: -vv

        Q. We should always save the output of our scans -- this means that we only need to run the scan once (reducing network traffic and thus chance of detection), and gives us a reference to use when writing reports for clients.
           What switch would you use to save the nmap results in three major formats?
        Ans: -oA

        Q. What switch would you use to save the nmap results in a "normal" format?
        Ans: -oN

        Q. A very useful output format: how would you save results in a "grepable" format?
        Ans: -oG

        Q. Sometimes the results we're getting just aren't enough. If we don't care about how loud we are, we can enable "aggressive" mode. This is a shorthand switch that activates service detection, operating system detection, a traceroute and common script scanning.
           How would you activate this setting?
        Ans: -A

        Q. Nmap offers five levels of "timing" template. These are essentially used to increase the speed your scan runs at. Be careful though: higher speeds are noisier, and can incur errors!
           How would you set the timing template to level 5?
        Ans: -T5

        Q. We can also choose which port(s) to scan.
           How would you tell nmap to only scan port 80?
        Ans: -p 80

        Q. How would you tell nmap to scan ports 1000-1500?
        Ans: -p 1000-1500

        Q. A very useful option that should not be ignored:
           How would you tell nmap to scan all ports?
        Ans: -p-

        Q. How would you activate a script from the nmap scripting library (lots more on this later!)?
        Ans: --script

        Q. How would you activate all of the scripts in the "vuln" category?
        Ans: --script=vuln


Scan Types Overview:-

        Q. Read the Scan Types Introduction.
        Ans: No answer needed


Scan Types TCP Connect Scans:-

        Q. Which RFC defines the appropriate behaviour for the TCP protocol?
        Ans: RFC 9293

        Q. If a port is closed, which flag should the server send back to indicate this?
        Ans: RST


Scan Types SYN Scans:-

        Q. There are two other names for a SYN scan, what are they?
        Ans: Half-Open, Stealth

        Q. Can Nmap use a SYN scan without Sudo permissions (Y/N)?
        Ans: N


Scan Types UDP Scans:-

        Q. If a UDP port doesn't respond to an Nmap scan, what will it be marked as?
        Ans: open|filtered

        Q. When a UDP port is closed, by convention the target should send back a "port unreachable" message. Which protocol would it use to do so?
        Ans: ICMP


Scan Types NULL, FIN and Xmas:-

        Q. Which of the three shown scan types uses the URG flag?
        Ans: xmas

        Q. Why are NULL, FIN and Xmas scans generally used?
        Ans: Firewall Evasion

        Q. Which common OS may respond to a NULL, FIN or Xmas scan with a RST for every port?
        Ans: Microsoft Windows

Scan Types ICMP Network Scanning:-

        Q. How would you perform a ping sweep on the 172.16.x.x network (Netmask: 255.255.0.0) using Nmap? (CIDR notation)
        Ans: nmap -sn 172.16.0.0/16


NSE Scripts Overview:-

        Q. What language are NSE scripts written in?
        Ans: Lua

        Q. Which category of scripts would be a very bad idea to run in a production environment?
        Ans: intrusive


NSE Scripts Working with the NSE:-

        Q. What optional argument can the ftp-anon.nse script take?
        Ans: maxlist


NSE Scripts Searching for Scripts:-

        Q. Search for "smb" scripts in the /usr/share/nmap/scripts/ directory using either of the demonstrated methods.
           What is the filename of the script which determines the underlying OS of the SMB server?
        Ans: smb-os-discovery.nse

        Q. Read through this script. What does it depend on?
        Ans: smb-brute


Firewall Evasion:-

        Q. Which simple (and frequently relied upon) protocol is often blocked, requiring the use of the -Pn switch?
        Ans: ICMP

        Q. [Research] Which Nmap switch allows you to append an arbitrary length of random data to the end of packets?
        Ans: --data-length


Practical:-

        Q. Does the target ip respond to ICMP echo (ping) requests (Y/N)?
        Ans: N

        Q. Perform an Xmas scan on the first 999 ports of the target -- how many ports are shown to be open or filtered?
        Ans: 999

        Q. There is a reason given for this -- what is it?
           Note: The answer will be in your scan results. Think carefully about which switches to use -- and read the hint before asking for help!
        Ans: No Response

        Q. Perform a TCP SYN scan on the first 5000 ports of the target -- how many ports are shown to be open?
        Ans: 5

        Q. Open Wireshark (see Cryillic's Wireshark Room for instructions) and perform a TCP Connect scan against port 80 on the target, monitoring the results. Make sure you understand what's going on. Deploy the ftp-anon script against the box. Can Nmap login successfully to the FTP server on port 21? (Y/N)
        Ans: Y
